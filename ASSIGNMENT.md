# Assignment

The task is to create a proof-of-concept for a simple web-based issue-tracking application. Clients can use the system to report bugs, issues, or requests concerning the company's products. The company's employees can view and modify the issues as needed. You should provide a basic SPA that users of the system will use to track issues.

Please write your solution using Python and React.

You should spend approximately **4 hours** on the assignment: you can decide for yourself which features you think are the most important and what can be implemented in this time. We do not expect a production-ready system, but it should be a working prototype that can serve as an initial version for future development. Please focus on the functionality, rather than the appearance. It should also show off your coding skills ;-).

## Suggested initial features

* Customers can access the system by providing a valid email address, name and affiliation.
* Customers can report issues, specifying a product (from a predefined list of the company's products) and severity, and describing the problem.
* Employees of the company can log in and view reported issues by product.
* Employees can edit individual issues: modify product, severity or description, or assign an issue to a specific employee.
